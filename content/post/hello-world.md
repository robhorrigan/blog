Hello and welcome to my blog. It's not much to look at yet, but hopefully over time I will post some interesting and informative posts, mostly centered around [**programming**](https://robhorrigan.github.io/blog/tags/programming/), [**technology**](https://robhorrigan.github.io/blog/tags/technology/), and [**software development**](https://robhorrigan.github.io/blog/tags/software-development/).

In the meantime, enjoy the fancy _**Ghostwriter**_ theme thanks to [JollyGoodThemes](https;//www.jollygoodthemes.com) and feel free to leave a comment below.
